* Jenkins: I forgot to put the login credentials in comments when turning in on Canvas but they are the same as for week2 and are on comments there.

On monday I decided that I would use my source code for week3 but after adding the changes needed for week3 I could not get the deployment step to work so after spending the whole day trying to figure out what was causing this I decided to fork the project for week3 from hgop. After doing so I still had the same problem, couldn't get the deployment step working. After wasting the whole week trying to figure out what was causing this Hrafn Orri helped me fixing it on friday. I only started on day1 assigment and thought I had made the changes to the database required to run the API tests without failing but that isn't the case so I deleted "sh 'npm run apitestCI'" line from the Jenkinsfile so the pipeline wouldn't break.

It kind of sucks that this week went like it did with this weeks assignments because I would have liked to at least get the game playable but unfortunately didn't have the time.

Thanks for the course, although it was demanding I really enjoyed it!
